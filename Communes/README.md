## Communes

This dataset details the evolution of the French Communes since their creation after the French Revolution. It was created by scrapping Wikipedia pages. It displays the use of stableBlockAreas as geometries to describe the evolution of communes. Some python script files are joined. They were used to create this dataset. The sequence is scrapping.py > changesToTimeline.py > toRDF.py. Note that some manual editions of the dataset 
 were carried out at each step in order to make up for some mistakes in the Wikipedia pages.
